# Pixelart Verifier

**Welcome to the Pixelart Verifier**

Pixelart Verifier is a WordPress plugin and it's basically just an updated version of the Aqua Verifier (also available on GitHub).

Pixelart Verifier uses the latest version of the Envato API and makes use of the newly available endpoints.
This plugin doesn't just upgrade the registration flow of your bbPress-powered support forum 
(like the Aqua Verifier did), it also gives you the ability to check the purchase information for each of your forum members via the users page in the WP admin backend.
It also allows you to update the data, and calculate the remaining support time (based on a 6 month support period).

Summed up, these are the Pixelart Verifier features:
- New registration process using the users purchase code
- Display support entitlement badge for each member of your bbPress forum
- Easily migrate the data from Aqua Verifier to Pixelart Verifier
- View / Update the purchase information of every user (purchased product, time of the purchase, user name, etc.), by pulling the lastest information from the Envato API.
- many more features...

**Note:** Support packages with 12 months of support aren't taken into account at the moment as they are not yet available via Envato API.


If you want to try the latest features, check out the development version, but it could be a bit buggy so don't use it on your production site!


You are free to use it in commercial ways, but we would be happy for a credit.
