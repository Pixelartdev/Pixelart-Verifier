# Pixelart Verifier

**Welcome to the Pixelart Verifier**

This is a Plugin WordPress, which is in basic just an updated version of aqua verifier here on GitHub.
This plugin uses the latest version of the Envato Api, and its newest possibilities.
So this plugin doesn't just gives you an updated registration flow on your WordPress support forum 
(like the aqua verifier did), this also gives you the possibility to check the purchase information of every user on your blog, using the users page in the WP admin backend, this also allows you to update the data, and calculate the support time left (based on a 6 month support period).

So in basic the functions are:
- New registration process using the users purchase code
- Show a badge in bbPress if the user has support left
- Migrate the data from the aqua verifier to our new pulgin without any problems
- View / Update the purchase information of every user (like the product bought, when it bought, user name, etc.)
- and many more features


Remember: Support packages with 12 months of support aren't considered right now, because the Envato Api doesn't gives this information at the moment.


You are free to use it in commercial ways, but we would be happy for a credit.
